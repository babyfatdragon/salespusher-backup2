Medix is focusing on the areas of  medical imaging technology; and has successfully developed three product lines: radiographic systems, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and computed tomography (CT) Scanners. Medix sell products to tertiary hospitals (state-run and bed capacity exceeding 500) and private hospitals directly, and also sell through distributors in southern part of China. With rising of middle class, hospital reforms, and population aging issue , the demand for quality equipment is growing at an unprecedented pace in China in coming years. To capture more opportunities in the market, **Medix is expanding its sales force by keep hiring additional sales employees monthly.** Overall, the company size is increasing. As the price of an arbitrary medical device is very high and there're many roles, at the client's side, involve in the buying-decision process, **the sale cycle of a medical device is very long**, which can be a few months or even a year. Usually there could be around 100 deals on going, however, only a few deals (normally less than 10) are closed monthly.
The long sale cycle always demotivate sales team. **The win/loss rate of deals is rather low.** In terms of the sales structure, the sales activities are divided into different provinces, each region has a sales manager to manage regional sales activities.

Alfred, Chief Commercial Officer

Benidict, Regional Sales Manager

Catherine, Sales Representative

Dennis, Sales Engineer

Ellen, Sales Assistant

Ford, Customer Service Engineer

**2. Describe their work flow each: WHAT are they responsible for? WHEN and WHERE do they work at?**

Alfred is the chief commercial officer of Medix. He is responsible for the commercial strategies of the company, which drives business growth and market share. He works in headquarter office in Guangzhou and generally reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO) of Medix. In terms of sales activities, he's responsible for tracking each region's business turnover, identifying business trend or hotspots in the whole market and coming up with strategies to drive sales amount based on his analysis. Alfred collects sales report from every region's sales manager every week and summarizes them in a final report. He cares more about the overview of sales activities of the company rather than details of each deal. However, these reports are always wordy and hard to capture the important information. Alfred also need to assemble the satistics from all regions to draft the final sales report. In addition, if the regional reports are not submitted timely, he has to delay the submission of final report to execute board as well. He needs to report all business activities and statistics (including revenue, cost, future budget), and predict future sales volume to execute board at the end of every month. 

Benedict is a regional sales manager of Medix, who is in charge of all sales activities in Guangdong province. He's the leader of the sales team in Guangdong. He sets sales target for each salesperson every month and assigns them different tasks, including meeting clients, daily visit, re-vist, arranging campaigns, etc. At the same time, he has to evaluate his team members based on their performance and do a review session with each member weekly. Moreover, Benedict have to handle with documents, such as approving requests for appropriation, reviewing bidding documents, drafting sales report, etc. He is also a sales representative and he need to meet clients(usually major clients) and search for potential opportunities. Every week he need to report sales activities to Alfred(market manager). He's responsible for all deals handled by his subordinates. As there are aound 20 salesperson under his supervision, and each salesperson normally involved in 3 to 5 cases, Benedict always struggles to track the progress of his subordinates. Due to the nature of sales work, most salesperson work outside of the office, whenever Benedict wants to assign a task to one of his team member, it always takes several phone calls and emails to comfirm the schedule of team members, then he could find a available member. In addition, the weekly review session is usually time-consuming, as he has to ask the reviewee to report his work in details first; consequently, the evaluation for each member is also ineffective. 

Catherine is a sales representative of Medix, and she works in Shenzhen office. She's responsible for winning deals and creating revenue for the company. Catherine usually pays daily visit to old clients, including doctors, physicians, hospital department dean and other distributors, and meets with new clients. If a client is interested in products pitched by her, normally they will ask for clinical trials first. Then Catherine should report to her sales manager and claim for a clinical trial. She's responsible for sending the product for clinical trials to clients. Afterwards, Catherine will try to satisfy the clients' needs in differnet aspects, such as arranging workshops, providing complementary products, etc. If everything goes well, She will arrange siging contract with the client, shipping the product,and payment collection. Also she has to look for an available customer service engineer to install the product for the client. If a customer service (maintenance or repair work) is requested from clients, Catherine need to contact an available service engineer to solve the issues. And she also has to follow this case and negotiate the charge with clients. Typically, she has 3-5 deals to follow, therefore Catherine sometimes fails to manage her task schedule, which leads to a loss of deal. Most of the time, Catherine is working outside of the office.

Dennis is a sales engineer of Medix, and he works in Shenzhen office. His daily routine is similar to Catherine. He has an engineering background and knows Medix's products well. Normally Benedict (Dennis's supervisor) will assign Dennis to high-level products with complicated design in terms of structure and usage. He is responsible to help install a product and teach clients the instructions of product. If a customer service (maintenance or repair work) is requested from clients, Dennis need to contact a service engineer to solve the issues. He has to follow this case and negotiate the charge with clients. 

Ellen is a sales assistant of Medix and she works in Shenzhen office. She's in charge of preparing document related to sales activities. For example, staff who request for appropriation will firstly report to Ellen, then Ellen will write a formal request letter to sales manager(Benedict) for approval. When the company receives an invitation of bidding, Ellen is responsible to prepare bidding documents. Ellen works at office during working hours.

Ford is a customer service engineer of Medix and he works in Shenzhen office. He is responsible for setting up products and teach clients about the product's instructions. When a customer service (maintenance or repair work) is needed, Ford will be dispatched to the client. The maintenance or repair fee is negotiatable as the condition of the products vary. Ford and the salesperson who sold this product, should negotiate with the client about the charge. Ford is not requested to find potential deals, but he is responsible for answering queires from clients,in phone calls or emails. Due to the diversity of products, Ford has to spend a long time for searching in a large number of product documents.

**3. Describe the application you think would improve their business process.**
 
Medix need an application that can manage all interactions with customers and future customers. Salespersons can update every details of a deal and their own time schedule.
